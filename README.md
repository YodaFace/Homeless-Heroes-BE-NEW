# Flask Boilerplate for Profesional Development

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

## Features

- Extensive documentation [here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/flask-rest-hello/tree/master/docs).
- Integrated with Pipenv for package managing.
- Fast deloyment to heroku with `$ pipenv run deploy`.
- Use of `.env` file.
- SQLAlchemy integration for database abstraction.

## How to Start the Project?

There is an example API working with an example database. All your application code should be written inside the `./src/` folder.

- src/main.py (it's where your endpoints should be coded)
- src/models.py (your database tables and serialization logic)
- src/utils.py (some reusable classes and functions)

For a more detailed explanation, look for the tutorial inside the `docs` folder.

## Remember to migrate every time you change your models

You have to migrate and upgrade the migrations for every update you make to your models:
```
$ pipenv run migrate (to make the migrations)
$ pipenv run upgrade  (to update your databse with the migrations)
```


# Manual Installation for Ubuntu & Mac

⚠️ Make sure you have `python 3.6+` and `MySQL` installed on your computer and MySQL is running, then run the following commands:
```sh
$ pipenv install (to install pip packages)
$ pipenv run migrate (to create the database)
$ pipenv run start (to start the flask webserver)
```


## Deploy to Heroku

This template is 100% compatible with Heroku[https://www.heroku.com/], just make sure to understand and execute the following steps:

```sh
// Install heroku
$ npm i heroku -g
// Login to heroku on the command line
$ heroku login -i
// Create an application (if you don't have it already)
$ heroku create <your_application_name>
// Commit and push to heroku (commited your changes)
$ git push heroku master
```
:warning: For a more detailed explanation on working with .env variables or the MySQL database [read the full guide](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/flask-rest-hello/blob/master/docs/DEPLOY_YOUR_APP.md).

# WebApp boilerplate with React JS
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp.git)

### Requirements:
- Make sure you are using node version 10

1. Install the packages:
```
$ npm install
```
2. Create a .env file:
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```
3. Start coding!

Start the webpack server with live reload:

```
`$ npm run start` for windows, mac, linux or Gitpod.
```

### Styles
You can update the `styles/index.scss` or create new `.scss` files inside `styles/` and import them into your current scss or js files depending on your needs.

### Components
Add more files into your `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them and import them into your current files as needed.

**Note (New changes)**: Components have been converted into functions to support the use of hooks:
* Instead of a class component, we're using a `const` function.
* Class `constructor` and `state` have been replaced by `useState()` hooks.
* `componentDidMount()` was replaced by `useEffect({}, [])` - It runs at mount thanks to the second parameter (`[]`).
* `Actions` and `Store` still work the same way.

```jsx
// Previous "Class Oriented"
export class Demo extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);

		this.state = getState('code here');
	}
}

// New "Functional Oriented"
export const Demo = () => (
	const [state, setState] = getState('code here'); //using the state (if needed)
  const { store, actions } = useContext(Context); // using the context (if needed)

);
```

💡Note: There is an example using the Context API inside `views/demo.js`;

### Views (Components)
Add more files into your `./src/js/views` and import them in `./src/js/layout.jsx`.

### Context
This boilerplate comes with a centralized general Context API. The file `./src/js/store/flux.js` has a base structure for the store, we encourage you to change it and adapt it to your needs.

React Context [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
BreathCode Lesson [view](https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/react-hooks-explained)

The `Provider` is already set. You can consume from any component using the useContext hook to get the `store` and `actions` from the Context. Check `/views/demo.js` to see a demo.

```jsx
import { Context } from "../store/appContext";
const MyComponentSuper = () => {
  //here you use useContext to get store and actions
  const { store, actions } = useContext(Context);
  return <div>{/* you can use your actions or store inside the html */}</div>
}
```

## Publish your website!

1. **ZEIT:** The FREE recomended hosting provider is [http://zeit.co/](http://zeit.co/), you can deploy in 1 minutes by typing the following command:
```sh
$ npm i now -g && now
```
✎ Note: If you get asked for credentials you have to type `$ now` after login in.

![Zeit example procedure to deploy](https://ucarecdn.com/4041f971-8dd9-4dc2-84fb-4645ab42c856/)

2. **Github Pages:** This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free github pages hosting.
To publish your website you need to push your code to your github repository and run the following command after:
```sh
$ npm run deploy
```
Note: You will need to [configure github pages for the branch gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages)
